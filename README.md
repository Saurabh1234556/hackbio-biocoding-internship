Function Scripts for DNA Translation, Logistic Growth and Hamming Distance Determination
üìå Task Overview
Here are four Python functions for various biological computations:

dna_to_protein: to translate DNA sequence into protein sequence.
generate_logistic_growth_curves: for generating multiple logistic growth curves with variations in lag and exponential phases.
time_to_80_percent_growth: to determines the time needed to reach 80% of the carrying capacity.
hamming_distance: for calculating the Hamming distance between pairs of usernames.
üõ† Requirements
Python 3.x
üì• Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/SamuelEA25/HackBio-Coding-Internship.git
üöÄ Testing the Function Script
Open your command line interface and locate the file directory for script1:

cd path/to/script1
Enter the interactive mode for Python by entering this command:

python
Import the script (script1) and manually call each functions to test them

1Ô∏è‚É£ Translate DNA to Protein:

from script1 import dna_to_protein
dna = "TCCAGATCCACAAGCCCAACTTTCAACAAA"
print("Protein sequence:", dna_to_protein(dna))
2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Logistic Growth Curves:

from script1 import generate_logistic_growth_curves
growth_curves = generate_logistic_growth_curves(num_curves=10, max_time=20)
print("Generated logistic growth curves:", growth_curves[:2])
3Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate Time to 80% of Carrying Capacity:

from script1 import time_to_80_percent_growth
K, P, r = 1000, 10, 0.1
time_to_80 = time_to_80_percent_growth(K, P, r)
print("Time to reach 80% of carrying capacity:", time_to_80)
4Ô∏è‚É£ Compute Hamming Distance:

from script1 import hamming_distance
distance1 = hamming_distance("AmakaMadubuike", "AmakaMadubuike")
distance2 = hamming_distance("Mirra", "mirr9")
distance3 = hamming_distance("PreciousGift", "PreciousGift")
distance4 = hamming_distance("SamuelEA", "Samuel18")
distance5 = hamming_distance("DrIhotu89", "Cyndy8436")
distance6 = hamming_distance("Saurabh", "Saurabh")
print("Hamming Distance Results:")
print(f"AmakaMadubuike vs AmakaMadubuike: {distance1}")
print(f"Mirra vs mirr9: {distance2}")
print(f"PreciousGift vs PreciousGift: {distance3}")
print(f"SamuelEA vs Samuel18: {distance4}")
print(f"DrIhotu89 vs Cyndy8436: {distance5}")
print(f"Saurabh vs Saurabh: {distance6}")
